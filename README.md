# Mondo-Dashboard

Mondo-Dashboard is a project to build out a working web based "clone" of the existing iOS Mondo application,
currently it features a transaction list and transaction view similar to the feed on the iOS app.
However there are plans to include further features such as
- [ ] Spending Maps
- [ ] Reports
- [ ] Search

I aim to include further features made available to the app when they're launched in the API.
